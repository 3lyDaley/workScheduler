This project is expected to provide a daily planner for scheduling. The current day and time is present at the top of the page, and the time blocks represent standard business hours, color coded for past, present, and future. When any time block is clicked, the user is able to enter an event and save it to that time block. The text is saved in local storage to persist when the page is reloaded.
